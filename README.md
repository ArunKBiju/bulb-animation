# ⭐ Bulb Animation – Pendulum Light Reveal

A creative and interactive web animation featuring a swinging light bulb that mimics the motion of a pendulum. Initially, the bulb is off and sways gently like a clock pendulum. When the user clicks the switch, the bulb lights up and reveals a hidden message on the screen.
